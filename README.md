# Crypto Trading Bot

A Python-based trading bot that monitors and trades 50 cryptocurrency pairs on Binance using a simple moving average (SMA) crossover strategy with real funds. It includes a wallet withdrawal feature and logs trades in the console.

## Features
- **50 Coins**: Trades 50 popular USDT pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, XRP/USDT).
- **SMA Strategy**: Buys when the 3-period SMA crosses above the 10-period SMA; sells when it crosses below.
- **Wallet Withdrawals**: Prompts every 60 seconds to withdraw funds to an external wallet.
- **Console Output**: Displays price, SMAs, signals, and recent trades for each coin.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Binance account with API keys (create at [Binance API Management](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management))
- Dependencies:
  - `ccxt`: For Binance API interaction
  - `pandas`: For data handling
  - `numpy`: For calculations
  - `ta`: For technical indicators
  - `python-dotenv`: For environment variables

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository** (or save the script as `trading_bot.py`):
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>

2. Install Dependencies
- pip install ccxt pandas numpy ta python-dotenv
  
3. Set Up Environment Variables
- Create a `.env` file in the project directory:
- API_KEY=your_binance_api_key
- API_SECRET=your_binance_api_se-
cret
- Replace your_binance_api_key and your _binance_api_secret with your live Binance API credentials.
- Ensure the API has trading and withdrawal permissions enabled.

## Usage
1. Modify the Code for Live Trading:
- Open trading_bot.py and remove or comment out this line:
- exchange.set_sandbox_mode (True)
- This ensures the bot uses the live Binance API instead of the testnet.
  
2. Run the Bot:
- python trading_bot.py
- The bot starts trading with real funds on Binance and processes 50 coins every 2 seconds.


3. Monitor Output:

4. Withdraw Funds:
- Every 60 seconds, youâ€™ll see:
- Enter coin to withdraw (e.g., BTC, ETH, XRP) or 'skip':
- Enter a coin (e.g., `XRP`), amount (e.g., `1.0`), and testnet wallet address, or type `skip`.


5. Stop the Bot:
- Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.


## Configuration
- Coins: Edit the SYMBOLS list in trading_bot.py to change the 50 pairs.
- Trade Amounts: Adjust TRADE_AMOUNTS for custom quantities (e.g., 0.001 BTC, 0.1 SOL, 1.0 XRP).
- Timeframe: Change TIMEFRAME (default: 1m) to 5m, 15m, etc., if desired.
- SMA Periods: Modify window=3 and window=10 in analyze_data() for different SMA lengths.


## Notes
- Live Trading: This bot uses real funds via the Binance API.
- Double-check TRADE_AMOUNTS and test with small amounts first to avoid unintended losses.
- Rate Limits: 2-second sleep avoids
Binance API limits for 50 coins.
- Errors: If a coin fails (e.g., market unavailable), it skips to the next one.
- Security: Keep your .env file secure and never share your API keys.

- Performance: Increase
time.sleep (2) if rate-limited by Binance.
